Correctly initialize the boundary variables left and right. 
Only one rule: set up the boundary to include all possible 
elements;

Decide return value. Is it return left or return left - 1?
Remember this: after exiting the while loop, left is the 
minimal kâ€‹ satisfying the condition function;

Design the condition function. This is the most difficult 
and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.
